[egui] integration for splatter. Useful for throwing together quick UIs for splatter
apps, sketches and other experiments.

For inspiration on how to expose UI widgets, please see the [egui] repo and its
plethora of examples. There are sliders, color pickers, checkboxes,
drop-down-lists and many more widgets to play with.

For information on how to integrate it to your splatter creations, see the repo
examples.
