# About the Codebase

The splatter community uses [git][git] for managing and collaborating on all code
and documentation, including this guide! At the moment, the main code repository
(repo) is hosted [at Github][splatter-github].

### Pull Requests

All code changes and code reviews for splatter happen through "Pull Requests"
(PRs). If you are new to pull requests, there are [many great guides out
there][duckduckgo-pr], but in short they are a nice way of proposing, reviewing,
discussing and merging changes to a codebase.

In the next section we'll take a look at a checklist for opening PRs at the
splatter repo.
