# splatter

A Rust-based framework for creating generative art.

## Origins
`splatter` was forked from [splatter](https://splatter.cc) with the primary goal of focusing on creating 2D generative art, whereas `splatter` does much more than that.
If you'd like to do things with audio, hardware, etc `splatter` will be a much better fit for what you're looking for.

In order to focus on generative art and be able to move faster I decided it would be easier to fork `splatter` and remove all of the capabilities that I don't need.
